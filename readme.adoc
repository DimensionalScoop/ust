I'm creating my very own RPG setting.

Instead of building a whole world, in this setting there is just one sinkhole.
It is a crater-like structure of several 100 m in diameter that contains a whole, completely isolated ecosystem.
There is a small and sleepy town at the very top and the depths below that beg to be explored. This hole goes down a long way.
